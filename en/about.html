            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’m Michael, an IT expert with over ten years of experience, supported by a solid educational background,
                including my time at the FAAI. My expertise spans programming languages such as C#, PowerShell,
                JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. I specialize in SCCM for server and client software distribution, advanced
                PowerShell scripting, and designing user-friendly interfaces. I am passionate about creating intuitive,
                engaging user interfaces and developing efficient automation scripts tailored to my clients' specific
                needs.</p>
            <p>I offer a wide range of services, including advanced PowerShell scripting, SCCM integration, custom
                website and UI design, and converting PSD (Sketch/Mockup) to HTML/CSS. Additionally, I handle
                customization and bug fixing. As a fluent speaker of both German and English, I ensure quick response
                times, professional communication, and top-quality assurance.</p>
            <p>Whether you need a simple script modification, an advanced SCCM solution, or a beautifully designed user
                interface, I provide personalized, high-quality services that are perfectly aligned with your
                requirements. My dedication to delivering the best possible results makes me a reliable partner for your
                IT projects.</p>
